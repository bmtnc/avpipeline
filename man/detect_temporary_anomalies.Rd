\title{Detect Temporary Anomalies Using Lookback/Lookahead Baseline}
\usage{
detect_temporary_anomalies(values, lookback = 4, lookahead = 4, threshold = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{Numeric vector of time series values to analyze for anomalies}

\item{lookback}{Integer number of periods to look back for baseline calculation}

\item{lookahead}{Integer number of periods to look ahead for baseline calculation}

\item{threshold}{Numeric threshold multiplier for MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) detection}
}
\value{
Logical vector of same length as values, TRUE indicates anomalous observation
}
\description{
Identifies temporary anomalies in time series data using a baseline calculated from
surrounding observations. For each point, establishes a baseline from lookback and
lookahead windows (excluding immediate neighbors to prevent contamination), then
flags points that deviate significantly from this baseline using MAD threshold.
